Sample Welcome Letter
---------------------

Welcome to the HPCBIOS environment.

Below we outline the procedure required for obtaining access on HPCBIOS HPC resources. 

Login Node Names for HPC Resources
If you have been successful in your request, you (and your collaborators) are being granted access to the HPCBIOS HPC resource(s) as indicated in your notification email.
The login nodes of the available systems are the following:

  * System1 (Location1) : node1.example.org
  * System2 (Location2) : node2.example.org
  * System3 (Location3) : node3.example.org

Obtaining an Account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To gain access to one of the above HPC resources please do the following:

a. Print, complete, sign and fax the Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP) for the resource you have been granted access to (fax no: +XYZ-AB-CDEFGHIJ).
The AUP is available in .pdf & .doc formats from the HPCBIOS website (URL).
Insert “Project Reference code” as appropriate.

b. Each registered project member should request a user account on the allocated HPC resource(s) by completing the following form:
(URL)


Please note:
  * You will not be granted a user account on a HPC resource if you have not completed this form.
  * If accepted project is allocated on a specific HPC site, you will be allowed access to your project allocated site(s)
  * As an external, you may not be granted access unless you are registered as a collaborator in an accepted project. Additional collaborators can be registered by the project leader by contacting XYZ.
  * If you are permitted to access to more than one HPC resource you will have to complete the forms for each permitted site – each time choosing the appropriate (and different) HPC resource you are entitled to use. 

Once the above has been done, you will be contacted by the HPC site to request your ssh public key.
