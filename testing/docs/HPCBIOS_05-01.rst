HPCBIOS_05-01: Multiple-Version Software Policy
===============================================

.. note::
  A minimum set of versions of third party and open source software are
  recommended at all HPCBIOS participating sites.

  * BC Policy: HPCBIOS_05-01
  * Date of Policy: 1st November 2012

These versions are:
* A primary production version; (MUST)
* A previous production version for validation and verification purposes; (SHOULD)
* Beta or Release-Candidate version to be made available within first month of that release. (RECOMMENDED)

These three versions will vary by package and system, but users should
have the ability to test newer versions as they become available and
still have access to production versions. No attempt will be made to
force vendors to provide three versions immediately. There should be a
migration to this policy over time with the Baseline Configuration
compliance procedure used to track progress and ensure that versions are
added/updated as appropriate.

.. seealso::
  The primary concern of this policy is that, when a new production
  version of a package is being deployed at an HPC site it will not
  disturb the existing userbase. It is at siteâ€™s discretion to decide
  which version is the current default but, it should still allow at least
  one previous production version to serve gracefully users who have
  incompatibilities with newer software and, also allow for testing in advance.
