HPCBIOS_2012-96: Common Set of Commercial Compilers
===================================================

.. note::

  Providing commercial compilers is imperative for many user groups.

  * BC Policy: HPCBIOS_2012-96
  * Date of Policy: 2012-12-15

Thus, to increase user productivity and expand commonality across
HPCBIOS sites, sites shall install the following commercial compilers,
either through a userâ€™s default path or the availability of a module file.

In addition, in order to truly take advantage of the modern HPC
environment, *MPI support for the commercial compilers suite MUST be
implemented* for compliance with this policy, with any MPI stack.

It is at the discretion of each site which (if any) libraries will be
compiled with the commercial compilers. Ultimately, it will be the
responsibility of each user of the commercial compilers to create the
libraries that they require for their compiled software (at user or group context).

.. note::

  The current form of this policy does not specify 32 bit vs 64 bit or any other architecture,
  though it is expected that the native architecture of a
  given system (typically a 64 bit variant) is supported as the default target.
